# DILoggingPoC
This is a Proof of Concept for using Dependency Injection to setup Serilog logging within a standard ASP.NET Core web API application. The majority of the code is as generated by Visual Studio apart from the Dependency Injection of Serilog (.UseSerilog within Program.cs), the updating of the appsettings.json with the required logging configuration and a single log within the WeatherForecastController.Get() method.
